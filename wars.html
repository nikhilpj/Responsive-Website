            Iraqi T-72 Ural (1973)s, T-72 Ural Modernization, T-72Ms and T-72M1s
            were used successfully throughout the Iran-Iraq War and in countless
            operations, among others Operation Nasr, in the battle for Basra and
            during the Tawakalna ala Allah Operations. 105 mm M68 tank guns and
            TOW missiles proved ineffective against the frontal armour of Iraqi
            T-72s.[92][93] Sixty T-72 tanks were lost during the eight years of
            war.According to Iranians and Iraqis, the T-72 was the most feared
            tank of the Iranâ€“Iraq War.Despite their decisive victory, 45 Iraqi
            tanks and 50 other armored vehicles were destroyed. Since they
            fought from static positions, they were easier targets for attack
            helicopters. Nevertheless, their losses could be replaced, while the

            During the First Chechen War (December 1994 to September 1996)
            fought between the Russian Federation and the self-proclaimed
            Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, led by Dzhokhar Dudayev, the Russian
            Federation deployed both T-72 and T-80 tanks. Russian AFV losses
            during the first three months fighting amounted to 62 tank
            (T-72/T-80) losses (44 T-72s of 141, 18 T-80s of 71 and 0 PT-76s of
            9). Analysis of damage to non repairable vehicles showed that no
            T-72 were lost to frontal penetration of the hull from man portable
            anti tank weapons

            The Russian army captured seven of Dudayev's T-72s and used them in
            combat. During the First Chechen War, at least two tank duels took
            place. In the first, Dudayev's T-72A knocked out one T-62M belonging
            to pro-Russian Chechens. In the second, one of Dudayev's T-72As was
            destroyed by a Russian T-72B. Three Russian T-72s are recorded as
            destroyed, at the hands of Chechen separatists, including one tank
            during the Second Chechen War, during the period 1997 to 2003.

            The T-72 has seen extensive service in the 2022 Russian invasion of
            Ukraine with both sides.[126] Russia's most numerous tank is the
            T-72B3 (mod. 2011 and 2016) and the older T-72B (mod. 1985 and
            1989).[127] In the buildup to the invasion, Russian forces applied
            improvised steel grilles to the top of the turret, known as "cope
            cages" by some commentators.[128][129][130] Military analysts have
            speculated that such grilles were added in an attempt to counter the
            usage of top-attack weapons, such as the US made FGM-148 Javelin and
            British-Swedish NLAW, by Ukrainian forces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before the invasion, Ukraine owned T-72s left from the Soviet Union
            but were partly modernized.[citation needed] These mainly included
            T-72As and T-72AVs, as well as modernized T-72AMTs (mod. 2017).[141]
            On 3 April, an image of a rare T-72 "Ural" (1973) equipped with
            Kontakt-1 ERA having been damaged appeared.[142] As of April 2022,
            an unspecified number of Czech T-72M1s had been provided to
            Ukraine.[143] Poland also donated over 200 T-72M1/M1R tanks to
            Ukraine.[144][145] The Ukrainian Army had lost a total of 247 T-72
            tanks as of June 19, 2024
