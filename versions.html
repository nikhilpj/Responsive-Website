            The Ural is the first generation of the famous T-72 series of
            tanks.The T-72 is a major design change from the earlier T-55 and
            T-62 series of tanks. The T-72 is a new design incorporating more
            advanced technology. The crew is reduced from 4 to 3 due to the
            introduction of an automatic loader.The tracked chassis provides the
            T-72 with good all terrain mobility. The 780 hp V-46 diesel engine
            provides an improved power to weight ratio over the earlier T-55.
            The maximum speed is about 60 km/h on road, and on average 35 km/h
            in the field. Detachable fuel drums at the rear increase the
            operational range.
          </p>

          <p>
            The T-72 can ford through water and when using a snorkel rivers up
            to 5 m deep can be traversed.The T-72 Ural is armed with the
            smoothbore 125mm 2A26M2 cannon, the precursor to the 2A46.A 7.62mm
            PKT machine gun is mounted as a coaxial weapon. At the commander's
            position there is a 12.7mm NSVT heavy machine gun.
