          The T-72 was a product of a rivalry between design teams. Morozov KB
          was led by Alexander Morozov in Kharkiv. Uralvagon KB was led by
          Leonid Kartsev in Nizhny Tagil. To improve on the T-62, two designs
          based on the tank were tested in 1964: Nizhny Tagil's Object 167
          (T-62B) and Kharkiv's Object 434
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          During development the tank was code-named "Ural" after the Ural
          mountain region. Uralvagonzavod produced the first prototype with a
          T-62 turret, D-81 125-mm gun and V-45 engine in January 1968. Ob. 439
          differed so greatly from the T-64 that it was redesignated as "Object
          172"
        </p>
        <p>
          An initial production run began in 1972 at Nizhni Tagil. These were
          trialed in the Soviet Army. A final trial batch was built as "Object
          172M" and tested in 1973 and accepted into service as the "T-72" in
          1974

          The first series production of T-72 Object 172M began in July at UKBM
          in Nizhny Tagil.The T-72 was the most common tank used by the Warsaw
          Pact from the 1970s until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. It
          was also exported to other countries, such as Finland, India, Iran,
          Iraq, Syria and Yugoslavia, as well as being copied elsewhere, both
          with and without licenses.The T-72 quickly gained popularity among
          Soviet-aligned countries and was exported to numerous nations
          worldwide.

          The T-72, in its modernized form, now represents the bulk of the
          Russian armored forces, and was adopted by the best armored units in
          all Eastern Europe forces. It was widely exported despite its price
          -double of that of a T-55- because it represented a good compromise,
          not complicated to operate and maintain, with many commonalities with
          previous models. It was a real upgrade in firepower, protection, speed
          and even fire accuracy compared to previous models, and even
          contemporary western MBTs. Unlike the T-62, the T-72 became an instant
          hit, was well-modernized over decades and is still frontline today, in
          thirty-six armies.
