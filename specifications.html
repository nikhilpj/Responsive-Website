            The T-72 has a nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) protection
            system. The inside of both hull and turret is lined with a synthetic
            fabric made of boron compound, meant to reduce the penetrating
            radiation from neutron bomb explosions. The crew is supplied clean
            air via an air filter system. A slight over-pressure prevents entry
            of contamination via bearings and joints. Use of an autoloader for
            the main gun allows for more efficient forced smoke removal compared
            to traditional manually loaded ("pig-loader") tank guns, so NBC
            isolation of the fighting compartment can, in theory, be maintained
            indefinitely.
          </p>
          <p>
            In real-world scenarios, the NBC Protection Systems have
            demonstrated their ability to mitigate the impact of chemical and
            biological warfare agents, preventing contamination and minimizing
            casualties. Through advanced filtration, overpressure systems, and
            detection equipment, these systems provide a layered defense
            mechanism that enhances the survivability of military units facing
            NBC threats. These systems are designed to detect, neutralize, and
            protect against harmful agents, ensuring the safety and operational
            readiness of troops in hostile environments.

            Armour protection of the T-72 was strengthened with each succeeding
            generation. According to retired major, James M. Warford, variants
            developed after the T-72 base model and T-72M/T-72G MBT, featured a
            cast steel turret that included a cavity filled with quartz or sand
            in a form similar to US "fused-silica" armour.[49] The T-72 Model
            1978 (Obiekt 172M sb-4), which entered production in 1977, featured
            a new turret with special armour composed of ceramic rods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several T-72 models featured explosive reactive armour (ERA), which
            increased protection primarily against high-explosive anti-tank
            (HEAT) type weapons. Certain late-model T-72 tanks featured
            Kontakt-5 ERA, a form of universal ERA partly effective against
            kinetic penetrators. It was added to the T-72 as a response to
            testing conducted by the Soviet Union against captured Israeli
            Magach-4 tanks which found that the glacis of the T-72 could be
            penetrated by the 105mm M111 APDSFS Hetz ammunition.

            The T-72 is equipped with the 125 mm (4.9 in) 2A46 series main gun,
            a significantly larger (20-mm larger) calibre than the standard 105
            mm (4.1 in) gun found in contemporary Western MBTs, and still
            slightly larger than the 120 mm/L44 found in many modern Western
            MBTs. As is typical of Soviet tanks, the gun can fire anti-tank
            guided missiles, and standard main gun ammunition, including HEAT
            and APFSDS rounds.The stated barrel life expectancy of the 2A26M2
            model gun was 600 rounds of HE/HEAT equivalent to 600 EFC (Effective
            Full Charge) or 150 rounds of APFSDS.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main gun of the T-72 has a mean error of 1 m (39.4 in) at a
            range of 1,800 m (1,968.5 yd). Its maximum firing distance is 3,000
            m (3,280.8 yd), due to limited positive elevation. The limit of
            aimed fire is 4,000 m (4,374.5 yd) with the gun-launched anti-tank
            guided missile. The T-72's main gun is fitted with an integral
            pressure reserve drum, which assists in rapid smoke evacuation from
            the bore after firing. The 125 millimeter gun barrel is certified
            strong enough to ram the tank through forty centimeters of
            iron-reinforced brick wall, though doing so will negatively affect
            the gun's accuracy when subsequently fired.
